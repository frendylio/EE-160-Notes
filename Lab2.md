## Explore C Program Creation & Compilation
- Create 5 C Programs
    - Be sure that they compile and work
- This should be done individually
    - You can ask your teammates and me for help (Don't be afraid of asking questions).
- Everyone should submit all 5 files at the end of this lab.
- How to compile and run it (be sure to be in the same folder as your c file)
    ``` bash
        cc name_of_your_file.c
        ./a.out

        Notes:
        cc is used to compile your c file (gcc is another option instead of cc)
        ./a.out is to run your file
    ```
